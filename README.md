## The world's PREMIER domain name scraper

18,000 API hits per month = 600 hits per day

24 hours a day = 1440 minutes

1440/600(hits per day available) = 2.4 (about 2 API hits per minute)

Google trending terms gives back 20 domains at a time. 600 hits divided by 20 gives us 30 batch runs a day to check which of the 20 is available

1440/30 = 48 - meaning we could check the availability of 20 trending google terms every 48 minutes.
